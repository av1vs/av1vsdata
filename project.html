    <h2>Introducing the project</h2>
    
    <p><h3>In 2020, the Abraham Accords were signed between Israel, the UAE and Bahrain, with Morocco and Sudan subsequently joining the agreement. </h3></p>

    <pi><img src="aa.jpg" alt="Reg_picHW" width=100% height=auto></pi>

    <p><h3>The Abraham Accords were the first time some signatory nations officially recognised Israel and established diplomatic relations with the country, enabling open trade and cooperation in various fields.</h3></p>
      
    <p><h3>The aim of this project is to understand the factors which impact the extent to which citizens of Arab countries are disposed to their countries establishing diplomatic ties with Israel.</h3></p>
      
    <h2>The data</h2>

    <p><h3> The most crucial dataset used in this project are the results of the <a href= "https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/preview-arab-opinion-index-2022/">2022 Arab Opinion Index</a> created by the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies.</h3></p>

    <h2>The results of the Arab Opinion Index</h2>

    <p><h3> Below are the percentages of citizens in the 14 countries surveyed who support diplomatic recognition of Israel by their country.</h3></p>

    <div class="chart" id="Chart24"> </div>

    <p><h3>The results of the survey were published as an image on the Arab Centerâ€™s website, so I manually added the data to an excel file and used Python to convert the data into the JSON format.</h3></p>
   
    <h2>The initial regressions</h2>

<p><h3>I conducted several regressions to attempt to identify the correlation between various parameters (including GDP per capita and HDI) and the levels of support for diplomatic recognition of Israel in the 14 survey countries.</h3></p>

<p><h3>Below are four regressions out of the ten I conducted with the highest r squared values.</h3></p>

        <pi><img src="9a.jpg" alt="Reg_picHW" width=100% height=auto></pi>
        &nbsp;

        <pi><img src="10.jpg" alt="Reg_picHW" width=100% height=auto></pi>
        &nbsp;

        <pi><img src="6.jpg" alt="Reg_picHW" width=100% height=auto></pi>
        &nbsp;

        <pi><img src="3.jpg" alt="Reg_picHW" width=100% height=auto></pi>

  <p><h3>The above regressions were conducted using machine learning and python in Google Colab.<h3></p>

    <p><h3>For the Colab code, please click <a href= "https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1N6X5KK2k42bYXQ2x0_P0wEsdnsJP_PAD?usp=sharing">here</a>.</h3></p>

    <p><h3> The data for the HDI was downloaded as an excel file from the UNDP website. Data for the Muslim population and Jewish population in 1948/1972 was scraped from Wikipedia using python.<h3></p>

    <h2>The PROFNI Index</h2>

    <p><h3> Due to the relatively weak r squared values found in my initial regressions, I devised an index called the Propensity for Normalisation with Israel (PROFNI) Index in order to better understand factors that impact the propensity of Arab citizens for normalisation with Israel.</h3></p>

    <p><h3>An additional benefit of the index for the project is that it enables an understanding of the impact of qualitative factors that cannot be included in a regression (e.g. whether or not a country has diplomatic relations with Iran) on the propensity for diplomatic relations with Israel.</h3></p>

    <p><h3>The index score for each country was calculated by adding the individual scores of 8 parameters. A PROFNI score of 1 indicates the highest propensity for normalising relations with Israel and 0 indicating the lowest propensity.</h3></p>

    <p><h3>To calculate the PROFNI scores, I utilised both my initial regressions and some assumptions I have made regarding the factors that should impact the extent to which citizens of Arab countries are disposed to their countries establishing diplomatic ties with Israel.</h3></p>

    <p><h3>For example, all Arab nations that have signed peace or normalisation agreements with Israel to date are not democratic regimes,  so non-democratic countries are awarded a score of 1 for the "Democracy" parameter in the below table based on the assumption that non-democratic regimes are more likely to normalise relations with Israel.</h3></p>
  
	<pi><img src="table2.jpg" alt="Reg_picHW" width=100% height=auto></pi> <!--pi-->

  <p><h3> The data for relations with Iran, percentage of Muslims in the country, government regime type, banning of Muslim brotherhood and history of war with Israel was obtained from Wikipedia. Data for the distance from Israel was obtained from GlobeFeed.com<h3></p>

    <p><h3>The initial r squared of 0.13 found when regressing the PROFNI scores for all 14 survey countries is very low. However, after removing 4 outlier countries from the regression (Morocco, Qatar, Sudan and Algeria), the r squared for the 10 remaining countries was 0.87, indicative of a very strong positive correlation between the PROFNI Index score and support for diplomatic recognition of Israel.</h3></p>

    <p><h3>The above regressions were conducted using machine learning and python in Google Colab.<h3></p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p><h3>Based on the individual regressions I conducted, the single parameter which has the highest correlation with levels of support for the diplomatic recognition of Israel is the size of the Jewish population in the country in 1972.<h3></p>

        <p><h3>Based on the regression conducted for the PROFNI scores for the 10 countries, there is a strong positive correlation between support for diplomatic recognition of Israel and the 8 quantitative and qualitative parameters that are used to calculate the PROFNI scores.<h3></p>
      
          <p><h3> The strong positive correlation found in the PROFNI regression for the 10 countries is an exciting result. In terms of further work to be done, the PROFNI score can be calculated based on a broader range of parameters related to the economic, demographic and political features of the 14 survey countries, which will hopefully increase the r squared found in the regression and correct the scores for the four outlier countries to more accurately reflect their propensity for diplomatic relations with Israel.<h3></p>
